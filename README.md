# Animated portfolio website template
This repository is an extended version of another [portfolio template](https://shihabiiuc.github.io/portfolio/index.html) that is also created by me. In this portfolio template, I only added JavaScript animation (AOS). You can check the finished product [here](https://shihabiiuc.github.io/animated-portfolio/index.html).

This an one page portfolio template that you can download and use on your own project or to create a website. You are allowed to edit and make your portfolio website exactly the way you want.

_However, you're **not allowed to make it available for download on any other websites** or you can't exchange this template with any commercial intent._

This portfolio template is a part of my blog post and the [detail instruction can be found on the actual post.](https://shihabiiuc.com/animated-portfolio-website)

## Which niche best suits this template
I created this template for everyone who wants to create an online portfolio. Though it represents a **freelance graphic designer**. Yet, it's very easy to make changes to fit other industries. Such as **web designer, freelance writer, SEO expert, you name it.** This would be a great start if you're just getting started and thinking to build your portfolio. _I already did the heavy lifting for you._

## Mobile responsiveness
> This template is fully responsive for all kinds of devices. Also, it **does not need any CSS framework.**

## How does it work for you?
After you download the repository, you will find all the necessary files and folders. However, the **CSS file lives in the "sass" folder.** But you **don't have to use SASS.** The only file you need in this folder is _"style.css"_ and ignore all other partials (_file.scss).
I included these files (partials) because some of you may like to use SASS. But if you don't like SASS, just ignore the other files in the "sass" folder and only look/work on "style.css."

## Where to get support or if you have any questions?
Most of you may not need extra support or don't have questions because of the simplicity. But if it's you who need help or has a question, then find my contact detail here:
